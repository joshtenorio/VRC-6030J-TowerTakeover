# VRC-6030J-TowerTakeover
6030J's VRC Tower Takeover software archive

I didn't expect our season to end like this, but man it's been a great three years competing in VEX, and although Worlds was cancelled I'm glad my team and I were able to qualify in our last year. I'm kinda bummed out that my last HS tournament wasn't my best performance and that I wasn't able to completely finish odometry and pure pursuit, but regardless it's the end of my high school robotics career. Anyways I'm planning on working more on odometry/pure pursuit/motion planning as part of my 4th quarter work for robotics class, but in the meantime here's my code archive for the 2019-2020 season.

The repository has two main folders: one for Botty McBotface, our DR4B tray robot that competed in November, and Jest Kidding, our normal tray robot that competed for the rest of the season. Both robot software were developed using PROS and Okapilib. Additionally, included in the repository are my python utilities (autonplanner), which I primarily used to graph data collected from the robot's microSD card.

Anyways, happy coding!
